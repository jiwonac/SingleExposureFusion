* `Single_Exposure_Fusion.pdf` is a comprehensive report of theoretical background, what I did, and my assessment of results.
* The images shown in the pdf are all in the `data` directory.
* The Jupyter notebooks in this directory are self-contained. Any modern Jupyter notebook server should be able to run it. They were developed and tested for Google Colab.
* Since Deep Prior required heavy modification of the original code, I included all related code and the Jupyter notebook separately in the `deep prior` directory.
